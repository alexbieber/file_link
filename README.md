NOTES-->

HTML –
1)	BASICS
2)	All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
3)	The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
4)	The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
2)  <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>

     <h1>My First Heading</h1>
     <p>My first paragraph.</p>

     </body>
     </html>
3)  The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
<!DOCTYPE html>
