NOTES-->

HTML –
1)	BASICS
2)	All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: ```
3)	<!DOCTYPE html>
.```
4)	The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
5)	The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
2) ``` '
   <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>

     <h1>My First Heading</h1>
     <p>My first paragraph.</p>

     </body>
     </html>
   ```
3)  The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
<!DOCTYPE html>

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
Example
```
   <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
   <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
   <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
   ```
HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
Example
```
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   ```
```
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
   ```
